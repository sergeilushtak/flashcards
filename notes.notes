my normal git commands:

git add .
git commit -am 'added work with text (forgot to commit before)'
git push -u origin master


Resuming after a long break:
1. make sure you are connected to the internet (otherwise lots of stuff on flashcards won't work)
2. run this:

cd django_fc
source activate myDjango
python manage.py runserver 	


ItÂ´s also a good practice to push everything from pythonanywhere.com to github (state of all data) and then to pull it here before running anything.
