.pages should expire. the 'back' button should not be usable.

.update the 'times_asked' field

.'delete entry' button
	.need 'are you sure?' modal dialogs
.projects
	.project menu ('unspecified' on top, then 'new')
.floating window protocol
		.need either
			a mark field in vocentry

known bugs:
. if txt file doesn't contain 'date:' string the browser crashes at the end of upload file
. edit settings: mode field should be a drop down menu
. after-session stats are wrong  -------- CANT' REPRO SO FAR
. POSSIBLE SHARING PROBLEM: one user is doing a fc session. Another uploads file with 'overwrite the dictionary', which deletes some entries. Do automatically created numeric ids of the other entries get chaned? if yes, it will mess up the first user's fc session because the session entries are referenced (and fetched) by the ids. 

.upload file is way to slow (database write)

.chunk size fluctuates (+-1) during session (when _two_seater is used) - maybe something wrong with the engine
